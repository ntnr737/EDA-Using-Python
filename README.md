Our repository analyzes consumer behavior regarding pricing and discounts in the retail sector. 
We explore how higher initial prices, such as ₹3000, often lead to more significant discounts, like 30% or 25% off, 
impacting consumer perceptions of value. Additionally, we highlight the importance of price ranges between ₹0-1500 in attracting a wider customer base. 
Our research sheds light on the interplay between pricing strategies, discounts, and consumer preferences, offering valuable insights for retail businesses.
